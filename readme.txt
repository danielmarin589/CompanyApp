For this project, I developed a small app in which the user can add/remove employees from certain departments within a company. This was my very first app in Android Studio.

For the methods implementation(in the app) I used the following:
	- a method that adds a new employee by giving the position(of the employee) in the department
	- a method that removes an employee by giving the position(of the employee) in the department
	- a method that removes an employee onclick

I parsed a JSON file in order to display the office list.
